This program was created in the summer of 2022 for a "SUBGEO" geodetic company in the city of Sokolka.

Work in geodesy consists not only in field trips and recording the coordinates of the required points, but also in filling out a huge amount of papers and documentation. A decent part of the data in the documentation is repeated, so this process is can be automated.

The main task of the program is to enter data into the fields for entering information once and, as a result, receive completely completed documentation, which at times speeds up a very monotonous process.

The program also has a tool for combining PDF files and drawing signatures and pagination on the combined document.

Program for working with templates created in MS Word and MS Excel.
